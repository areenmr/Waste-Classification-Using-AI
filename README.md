# Waste Classification Using AI 

Our project classifies waste images into categories such as plastic, paper, metal, and glass using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to improve recycling efficiency and reduce environmental impact by automating waste sorting. The system is developed using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and Jupyter Notebook.
This project supports the UN Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)

# Dataset information 
The dataset contains labeled images of plastic, paper, metal, and glass.  
Images are organized into folders by category and loaded during preprocessing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Pillow

# How to run the model 
1. Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn pillow
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open the file Waste_Classification.ipynb.

4. Run all cells in order:
	-	Data loading
	-	Preprocessing
	-	Model training (CNN)
	-	Model evaluation (accuracy + confusion matrix)

5. Test the model by uploading an image in the notebook’s testing cell.
